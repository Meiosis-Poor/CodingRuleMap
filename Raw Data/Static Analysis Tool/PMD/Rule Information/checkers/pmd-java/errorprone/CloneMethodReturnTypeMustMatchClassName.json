  "description": "\nIf a class implements `Cloneable` the return type of the method `clone()` must be the class name. That way, the caller\nof the clone method doesn't need to cast the returned clone to the correct type.\n\nNote: Such a covariant return type is only possible with Java 1.5 or higher.\n        ",
  "example": "public class Foo implements Cloneable {\n    @Override\n    protected Object clone() { // Violation, Object must be Foo\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Foo implements Cloneable {\n    @Override\n    public Foo clone() { //Ok\n    }\n}",
