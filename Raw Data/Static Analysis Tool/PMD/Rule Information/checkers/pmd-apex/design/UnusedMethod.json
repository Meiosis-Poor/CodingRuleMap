  "description": "\nAvoid having unused methods since they make understanding and maintaining code harder.\n\nThis rule finds not only unused private methods, but public methods as well, as long as\nthe class itself is not entirely unused. A class is considered used, if it contains at\nleast one other method/variable declaration that is used, as shown in the\n[test project file Foo.cls](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/469b2a67ae375bde52bb33ccd4fb69e3c2993948/pmd-apex/src/test/resources/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/rule/design/UnusedMethod/project1/src/Foo.cls#L6-L8).\n\n[ApexLink](https://github.com/nawforce/ApexLink) is used to make this possible and this needs\nadditional configuration. The environment variable `PMD_APEX_ROOT_DIRECTORY` needs to be set prior to executing\nPMD. With this variable the root directory of the Salesforce metadata, where `sfdx-project.json` resides, is\nspecified. ApexLink can then load all the classes in the project and figure out, whether a method is used or not.\n\nFor an accurate analysis it is important that the `PMD_APEX_ROOT_DIRECTORY` contains a complete set of metadata that\nmay be referenced from the Apex source code, such as Custom Objects, Visualforce Pages, Flows and Labels. The\n`PMD_APEX_ROOT_DIRECTORY` directory must contain a `sfdx-project.json`, but metadata may be either in the\n[SFDX Source format](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_source_file_format.htm)\nor the older MDAPI format. The `packageDirectories` entries in `sfdx-project.json` are used to determine which\ndirectories to search for metadata, if a `.forceignore` file is present it will be respected.\n\nIf the Apex code references external packages via namespace(s) you should declare these in your `sfdx-project.json`\nfile using the 'plugins' syntax shown in the example below to avoid errors. Here's an example of a\nwell-formed `sfdx-project.json`:\n```json\n{\n    \"packageDirectories\": [\n      {\n        \"path\": \"src\",\n        \"default\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"namespace\": \"my_namespace\",\n    \"sfdcLoginUrl\": \"https://login.salesforce.com\",\n    \"sourceApiVersion\": \"52.0\",\n    \"plugins\": {\n        \"dependencies\": [\n            {\"namespace\": \"aa\"}\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n        ",
  "example": "public class Triangle {\n    private Double side1;\n    private Double side2;\n    private Double side3;\n\n    public Triangle(Double side1, Double side2, Double side3) {\n        this.side1 = side1;\n        this.side2 = side2;\n        this.side3 = side3;\n    }\n\n    // Method is not invoked so can be removed\n    public Double area() {\n        return (side1 + side2 + side3)/2;\n    }\n}",
