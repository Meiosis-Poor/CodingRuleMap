  "description": "All resources acquired by a class should be released by its destructor. Avoid the use of the 'open / close' pattern, since C++ constructors and destructors provide a safer way to handle resource acquisition and release. Best practice in C++ is to use the 'RAII' technique: constructors allocate resources and destructors free them.",
