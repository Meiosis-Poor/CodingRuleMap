This makes it easier to merge. While there are no problems at runtime.\n   This check is valuable only on files with string resources where order of lines\n   does not matter at all, but this can be improved.\n   E.g.: checkstyle/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/messages.properties\n   You may suppress warnings of this check for files that have a logical structure like\n   build files or log4j configuration files. See SuppressionFilter.\n   {@code\n   &lt;suppress checks=\"OrderedProperties\"\n     files=\"log4j.properties|ResourceBundle/Bug.*.properties|logging.properties\"/&gt;\n   }\n </p>\n\n <p>Known limitation: The key should not contain a newline.\n The string compare will work, but not the line number reporting.</p>",
