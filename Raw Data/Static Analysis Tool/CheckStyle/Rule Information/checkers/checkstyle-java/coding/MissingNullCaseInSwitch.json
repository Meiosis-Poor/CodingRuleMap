  "description": "<div>\n Checks that a given switch statement or expression that use a reference type in its selector\n expression has a {@code null} case label.\n </div>\n\n <p>\n Rationale: switch statements and expressions in Java throw a\n {@code NullPointerException} if the selector expression evaluates to {@code null}.\n As of Java 21, it is now possible to integrate a null check within the switch,\n eliminating the risk of {@code NullPointerException} and simplifies the code\n as there is no need for an external null check before entering the switch.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n See the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.28\">\n Java Language Specification</a> for more information about switch statements and expressions.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Specifically, this check validates switch statement or expression\n that use patterns or strings in their case labels.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Due to Checkstyle not being type-aware, this check cannot validate other reference types,\n such as enums; syntactically, these are no different from other constants.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n <b>Attention</b>: this Check should be activated only on source code\n that is compiled by jdk21 or above.\n </p>",
