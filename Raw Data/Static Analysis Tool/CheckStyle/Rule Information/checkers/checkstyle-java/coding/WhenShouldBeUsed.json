The {@code when} keyword is used to specify\n condition for a case label, also called as guarded case labels. This syntax is more readable\n and concise than the single {@code if} statement inside the pattern match block.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n See the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-14.html#jls-Guard\">\n Java Language Specification</a> for more information about guarded case labels.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n See the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.30\">\n Java Language Specification</a> for more information about patterns.\n </p>",
